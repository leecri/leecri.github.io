  <h1>Day 7 of making a website</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Day 7 of making a website.</p>
  <p>I must state that this isn't the seventh consecutive day of making a website but the seventh in total.</p>
  <p>I feel I should state this lest someone possibly thinks I'm conscientious enough to do this every single day.</p>
