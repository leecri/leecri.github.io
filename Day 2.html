<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>
  It's Day 2 of me learning how to make a website!
</p>

<p>
  So far I've learned how to:
  <ul>
  <li>Start a website from scratch. It always starts with the right tags</li>
  <li>Add paragraphs</li>
  <li>Add images</li>
  <li>Add videos and set its width and height, along with adding controls</li>
  <li>Add a Div element</li>
</ul> </p>
<p>
  Check out the video: </p>
