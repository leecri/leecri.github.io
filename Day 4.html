<h1> Day 4</h1>
<p>It's day 4 of my learning how to build a website! I've started CSS and it's making a lot of sense!</p>
<ul>I learned:
<li>what a link element is and its three attributes</li>
<li>what div elements are used for</li>
<li>about class selectors and ID selectors</li>
<li>some basic CSS like changing fonts, font colors, font size</li>
